## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-19

### üöÄ Major Feature: Automatic Issue Creation via GitHub Copilot

This release enables GitHub Copilot to automatically create issues when you describe work in conversation - no more manual form filling!

### Added
- **Automatic Issue Creation Instructions**: Added comprehensive Copilot instructions for detecting when users describe work and automatically creating GitHub issues
- **GitHub Authentication Flow**: Added interactive GitHub CLI authentication during `leo init` setup
- **Smart Intent Detection**: Copilot now recognizes patterns like "We need to fix...", "Let's add...", "There's a bug..." and creates issues automatically
- **Context Extraction**: Automatically extracts priority, type, component from user descriptions

### Changed
- **Copilot Instructions Enhanced**: Added detailed examples and rules for automatic issue creation at the top of instructions (CRITICAL section)
- **Init Command**: Now checks GitHub authentication and offers to authenticate interactively if not logged in
- **Package Optimization**: Further reduced package size by excluding more unnecessary files via improved .npmignore

### Improved
- **User Experience**: Users can now describe issues in conversation and Copilot creates them automatically
- **Authentication UX**: Clear prompts and guidance for GitHub authentication during setup
- **Package Size**: Maintained lean package size (46.8 KB) while adding new features

### How It Works
When you say to Copilot:
- "We need to fix the login button not working on mobile"
- "Let's add dark mode support"
- "The search is too slow"

Copilot will automatically:
1. Detect you're describing work
2. Extract key details (priority, type, component)
3. Run `leo issue` with smart defaults
4. Confirm issue creation with link

No more interrupting your flow to fill out forms!

## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **Package Publishing**: Added explicit `files` field to package.json to ensure all templates are included in npm package
- **Installation Flow**: Enhanced postinstall.js to detect local vs global installs and guide users accordingly
- **Smart Setup**: Postinstall now detects if you're in a git repo and prompts to run `leo init` for quick setup
- **Package Size**: Reduced package size from 94.1 KB to 45.3 KB by excluding unnecessary documentation files via .npmignore

### Added
- `.npmignore` file to exclude development documentation and keep package lean
- Auto-detection of existing LEO setup to avoid duplicate initialization
- Context-aware installation messages based on install type (global/local) and repository status

### Changed
- Improved postinstall messaging to clearly guide users on next steps
- Updated version references to 2.1.1 across banner and scripts

## [2.0.3] - 2025-10-18

### Changed
- **Brand Refresh**: Updated banner from "LEO WORKFLOW KIT" to "LEO-KIT" for cleaner, more memorable branding
- **Visual Enhancement**: Redesigned ASCII art banner with bold block letters for outstanding visual appeal
- **Compact Design**: Simplified compact banner for better readability on smaller terminals

### Design Details
- Full banner now uses modern block characters (`‚ñà‚ïó‚ïë‚ïù‚ïê‚ïî‚ïö`) for professional appearance
- Maintained golden yellow color scheme (#FFD700) for consistency with lion branding
- All three banner variants updated: full, compact, and welcome message
- Terminal width responsive behavior preserved
