## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-19

### üöÄ Major Feature: Intelligent Spec-First Decision Making

Copilot now intelligently decides whether to create a specification first or go directly to issues!

### Added

- **Intelligent Work Analysis**: AI analyzes complexity before creating issues
- **Automatic Spec Creation**: For complex features, creates specification files in `docs/specs/`
- **Spec Review Workflow**: Asks user to review specs before breaking down into issues
- **Decision Tree Logic**: Clear rules for when to create specs vs direct issues
- **Enhanced Workflow Diagram**: Updated to show spec-first decision flow
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Issue #4 resolved with complete guides

### Decision Rules

**Create SPEC First:**

- New features requiring architecture decisions
- Significant system changes (multiple components)
- Features needing design/planning (> 1 week)
- Work requiring team discussion
- Features generating multiple issues

**Direct ISSUE:**

- Bug fixes (clear problem/solution)
- Documentation updates
- Small enhancements (< 1 day)
- Adding tests
- UI polish/tweaks
- Single component refactoring

### Workflow Changes

**Complex Feature Example:**

```
User: "Add OAuth2 authentication"
‚Üí Copilot creates docs/specs/oauth2-authentication.md
‚Üí Asks user to review
‚Üí After approval, breaks into 5 focused issues
‚Üí Each issue added to project with Todo status
```

**Simple Task Example:**

```
User: "Fix login button on mobile"
‚Üí Copilot creates issue directly
‚Üí Adds to project with Todo status
‚Üí Ready to work immediately
```

### Improved

- **Copilot Instructions**: Major enhancement with spec-first decision tree
- **Workflow Diagram**: Now shows spec creation path vs direct issue path
- **Documentation**: Updated README with new workflow
- **Issue Quality**: Specs ensure better planning for complex work

### Technical Details

- Spec files created in `docs/specs/` with structured format
- Includes: Problem Statement, Solution, Technical Approach, Architecture, Criteria
- User review required before issue breakdown
- Multiple focused issues generated from approved specs

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-19

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-19

### üöÄ Major Feature: Automatic Issue Creation via GitHub Copilot

This release enables GitHub Copilot to automatically create issues when you describe work in conversation - no more manual form filling!

### Added

- **Automatic Issue Creation Instructions**: Added comprehensive Copilot instructions for detecting when users describe work and automatically creating GitHub issues
- **GitHub Authentication Flow**: Added interactive GitHub CLI authentication during `leo init` setup
- **Smart Intent Detection**: Copilot now recognizes patterns like "We need to fix...", "Let's add...", "There's a bug..." and creates issues automatically
- **Context Extraction**: Automatically extracts priority, type, component from user descriptions

### Changed

- **Copilot Instructions Enhanced**: Added detailed examples and rules for automatic issue creation at the top of instructions (CRITICAL section)
- **Init Command**: Now checks GitHub authentication and offers to authenticate interactively if not logged in
- **Package Optimization**: Further reduced package size by excluding more unnecessary files via improved .npmignore

### Improved

- **User Experience**: Users can now describe issues in conversation and Copilot creates them automatically
- **Authentication UX**: Clear prompts and guidance for GitHub authentication during setup
- **Package Size**: Maintained lean package size (46.8 KB) while adding new features

### How It Works

When you say to Copilot:

- "We need to fix the login button not working on mobile"
- "Let's add dark mode support"
- "The search is too slow"

Copilot will automatically:

1. Detect you're describing work
2. Extract key details (priority, type, component)
3. Run `leo issue` with smart defaults
4. Confirm issue creation with link

No more interrupting your flow to fill out forms!

### Added

- `.npmignore` file to exclude development documentation and keep package lean
- Auto-detection of existing LEO setup to avoid duplicate initialization
- Context-aware installation messages based on install type (global/local) and repository status

### Changed

- Improved postinstall messaging to clearly guide users on next steps
