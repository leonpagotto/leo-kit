Active development documentation, best practices, and technical guides.

**Current Docs:**

- `AUTH_LOGIC.md` - GitHub authentication flow and logic
- `BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Development best practices and guidelines
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing strategies and procedures

### üì¶ archive/ - Historical Documentation

## LEO Workflow

### Phase 1: Specification (Planning)

Write detailed specification files in `specs/` folder. Include problem statement, solution approach, technical details, and acceptance criteria.

**Process:**

1. Create spec file in `docs/specs/[feature-name].md`
2. Review and discuss with team
3. Get approval before coding

### Phase 2: Execution (GitHub Issues)

Convert approved specs into GitHub issues. Track all work in GitHub Projects. Reference issues in all commits.

**Process:**

1. Run `leo issue` to create issues from approved specs
2. Track work in GitHub Projects
3. Reference issues in commits: `feat: add feature (#42)`
4. Create PRs with "Closes #42"

**Remember: Specifications are FILES. Tasks are GITHUB ISSUES.**
